            <span>For me this article is a really thought-provoking one. The writer mainly discuss the development of some particular and essential inventions in humans' history and has a deep debating of how they improve human life as well as the advantage of them as what makes them outstanding. As a result. this passages is pretty technical but on the other hand, I've learned a lot about how the ordinary machines work in my life and how much effeort scientist or biologist had put in order to make the best innovation

        What impressed me most is the writer's discuss about the technology which is a double-edged sword. We rely on it, but it always bursts out wars or perishment when we use it. It has been a long time since ancient, human have wars because of the unbalance of technologies. As a saying goes:"Inequliaty rather than want is the cause of trouble. "
