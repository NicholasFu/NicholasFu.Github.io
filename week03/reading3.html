    <h1>Response to John Berger, ways of seeing</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I really like John Berger's opinion on how to connect moving people to still 
        paintings as "Because paintings are esseentially silent and still, the most 
        obvious way to manipulating them is to use movement and sound" Like in documentary,
        camera would moves in to remote the detail of the paintings as the whole. So as 
        human, by moving our bodies in close or far from that painting will enable us to
        have different understanding of the painting.
